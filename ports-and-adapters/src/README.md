To run the code, set up a python 3 virtual environment, then

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
`pip install -e .`

You will need Sqlite installed. For the API, you'll need write-access to the current directory, or you can just hack the connection string in adapters/flask.py

If you `cd issues` you can now run tests with `run-contexts -v`.

To run the API

```bash
$ export FLASK_APP=issues.adapters.flask
$ flask run 
 flask run
 * Serving Flask app "issues.adapters.flask"
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
127.0.0.1 - - [13/Sep/2017 13:50:50] "POST /issues HTTP/1.1" 201 -
127.0.0.1 - - [13/Sep/2017 13:50:57] "GET /issues/4d9ca3ab-3d70-486c-965b-41d27e0dbd33 HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

You can now post a new issue to the api.

```bash
$ curl -d'{"reporter_name": "carlos", "reporter_email": "carlos@example.org", "problem_description": "Nothing works any more"}' localhost:5000/issues -H "Content-Type: application/json" -v

*   Trying ::1...
* TCP_NODELAY set

And fetch the new issue from the URI given in the Location header.

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/issues/4d9ca3ab-3d70-486c-965b-41d27e0dbd33
{
  "description": "Nothing works any more", 
  "reporter_email": "carlos@example.org",
